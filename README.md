# git-templates
Template for Cloudrexx-related GIT repositories

## What's this
This contains all GIT hooks we use to develop for Cloudrexx. Currently this includes:
- PHP Linter
- Commit message linter

This list will probably get longer over time.

## Installation
Note: Before you install the templates you need to have docker and git installed on your computer.

If you have installed git and docker you can clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Cloudrexx/git-templates.git ~/.git_template`

After cloning the repository you should set your git templatedir:
`git config --global init.templatedir '~/.git_template'` 

## Update
To update to the newest version of our templates simply execute `git pull` in `~/.git_template`.

To update existing repositories call `git init` from within the repository. Don't worry, this simply replaces the files from the template in your ".git" folder.
